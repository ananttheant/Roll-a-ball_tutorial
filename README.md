# Roll a ball
The game is for introvert people trying to keep it low under stress ie being around uncomfortable people. Imagine a situation when are sitting with your friends and someone joins in who makes things stressful. This app would let you keep collecting a pick up object which will be spawned randomly and will be unlimited, So you have nothing to lose. The point is , you'll seem as if you are busy but you can concentrate on the conversation happening around you. And once you think you are done, just suicide (though there's some secret 420 mission try to find it)
